# flutter_test_cookbook

A community driven cookbook with _recipes_ (i.e., examples) on how to test your flutter application.

## Recipes

There are [three pillars](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing) of flutter tests:
1) unit
2) widget
3) integration

This cookbook is mostly concerned with 2 and 3.

Currently, [flutter_test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html) is used for widget tests, and [flutter_driver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html) is used for integration tests. However, it is possible that `flutter_driver` could eventually be deprecated, and `flutter_test` could be used for both widget and integration tests.

    We're moving away from flutter_driver in favour of extending flutter_test to work on devices.

Because of this, the recipes will be split out into two directories: `flutter_test` and `flutter_driver`
